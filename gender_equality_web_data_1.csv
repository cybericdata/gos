We need the younger generation to change the narratives on the way we run our country. I wish to invite the young lawyers to partner with my Ministry, the Women Affairs” she said.Speaking further, she said “we need to break the barrier if we must move forward as a country, there is one thin line of barrier which we need to break and that is the barrier of non-inclusivity of women in politics but how do we include the women in decision making when on 10 percent of women presently own properties in the country, that is to say that only 10 percent of women are eligible to join politics for now” she added.Barr Uju also said that women are naturally endowed with potentials to serve as key players in nation building but this can only be possible when they are empowered and given the voice as major stakeholders in national development.On rule of law, the Minister also frowned at the nation’s judicial process which is bereft of proper application of the rule of law “ part of the ways we address the issue of poverty in Nigeria is when the issues of man’s inhumanity to man and selfishness are removed in the scheme of things. The rule of law should apply to everybody without sentiments. During my recent visit to a Correctional Centre, I saw women who were serving jail terms for just N20,000.00 fine and had to pay N395,000.00 for the release of about 35 inmates including men. Just because some people have connection, their crimes are swept under the carpet and that is unfair and injustice. Nigeria will be better is the rule of law is applied accordingly” she also said.Other keynote speakers and dignitaries at the event were the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Chief Nyesom Wike, Hon. Justice Mary Odili, Chairman Body of Benchers, Sir Victor Benibor, Chairman Nigerian Bar Association, Port Harcourt Branch, Dr Nonso Enebeli, Chairman Young Lawyers Forum, Port Harcourt Branch, Hon Justice Okogbule Gbassam, Hon Justice Omonigho Nwibani, Rivers Sector Commander of the FRSC, Corps Commander Christopher Kuje among others.Ohaeri Osondu Joseph, Fnipr, FcaiSpecial Assistant, MediaLatest VideosPublications for DownloadsNGO REGISTRATION FORMGBV NATL GUIDELINES AND REFERRAL STANDARDSGender Assessment FINALIZED Report COPY_Feb 1314Mapping of Policies on GBV and HIVNPoA_GBV_HIV from Printer"
