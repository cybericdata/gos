This initiative aimed to strengthen female political participation and ensure that women play a more active role in Nigeria’s electoral processes.', 'The training brought together 20 female participants from state-based Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), carefully selected by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their strong presence and ongoing work within the state. These women were equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to serve as key mobilizers during the upcoming off-cycle elections in the eighteen Local Government Areas of Edo State.', 'To achieve these objectives, NWTF compiled a training manual with the assistance of its technical staff. This manual was guided by an existing CVE handbook, the Electoral Act 2022, and inputs from INEC. Gender issues were carefully integrated into the CVE training program to ensure that the concerns and experiences of both male and female citizens are adequately considered in all election-related activities.', 'The comprehensive training manual created by NWTF, containing 11 crucial modules. These modules covered a range of topics including “What is Democracy?”, “Achieving Voter Education,” “Duties and Obligations of a Nigerian Citizen,” “Rights of a Voter,” and “Electoral Offences,” among others. The handbook served as a valuable resource for participants, ensuring they had access to detailed and relevant information to effectively carry out voter education.', 'The training also included sensitization and awareness creation on the use of technology, particularly the BVAS (Bimodal Voter Accreditation System), in Nigeria’s electoral process. This component was vital, given the recent passage of the Electoral Act by the National Assembly and its subsequent assent by the President, mandating the use of technology in elections conducted by INEC.', 'The primary focus of the ToT was to build the capacity of these women to deliver on key aspects such as voter education, mobilizing women voters, constituency building, and outreach on women’s leadership and representation. This effort is part of NWTF’s broader mission to enhance the participation of female citizens in electoral and democratic processes across focal states.', 'This 3-day training in Ondo State marks a significant step towards empowering women to take on leadership roles in voter education and ensuring that their voices are heard in the upcoming elections. Through this initiative, NWTF continues to champion gender inclusivity and the active participation of women in Nigeria’s democratic processes.', 'Tags', 'Leave a ReplyCancel replyYour email address will not be published.Required fields are marked*Comment*Name*Email*WebsiteSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Δ', 'Your email address will not be published.Required fields are marked*', 'Comment*', 'Name*', 'Email*', 'Website', 'Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.', '', '', 'Δ', 'The Nigerian Women Trust Fund – NWTF\xa0 was created as a response to low representation of women in decision making process of Nigeria.', 'House H, Taheel EstatePlot 71 Cadastral Zone,Col.
